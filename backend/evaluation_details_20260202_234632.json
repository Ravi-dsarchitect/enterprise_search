The options for instalment payments include:\n   - Monthly\n   - Quarterly (every three months)\n   - Semi-annually (every six months)\n   - Annually\n\n3. **Settlement Option**: \n   - If the Life Assured has opted for a Settlement Option against the Maturity Benefit, they have the flexibility to withdraw this option.\n   - Upon receiving a written request from the Life Assured, the outstanding instalments can be commuted.\n   - In such cases, a lump sum amount is paid, which is the higher of:\n     - The discounted value of all future instalments due\n     - The policy terminates after this payment.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the policyholder receives their maturity benefits in a manner that suits their financial planning needs. \n\n[Source: 102294- Amritbaal Sales Brochure_MAR 25.pdf]"

This includes acts such as suggesting false facts, actively concealing facts, or any other deceptive acts [Source: LIC_Bima Shree _Sales Brochure_Eng_06112025.pdf].\n\n2. **Definition of Fraud**:\n   - Fraud is defined as any act committed with the intent to deceive the insurer or induce the insurer to issue a life insurance policy. This includes:\n     - Suggesting as a fact something that is not true.\n     - Active concealment of a fact by the insured.\n     - Any act or omission that is legally declared as fraudulent [Source: LIC_Bima Shree _Sales Brochure_Eng_06112025.pdf].\n\n3. **Onus of Proof**:\n   - In cases of fraud, if the policyholder is not alive, the onus of disproving the fraud lies upon the beneficiaries. They must demonstrate that the misstatement or suppression of a material fact was true to the best of the insured's knowledge and belief, or that there was no deliberate intention to suppress the fact [Source: LIC_Jeevan Umang_Sales Brochure_4 inch x 9 inch_Eng (1).pdf].\n\n4. **Timeframe for Contesting**:\n   - A life insurance policy may be called into question at any time within three years from the date of issuance of the policy or the date of commencement of risk [Source: LIC_Jeevan Umang_Sales Brochure_4 inch x 9 inch_Eng (1).pdf].\n\nThese procedures ensure that claims are reviewed fairly while providing an opportunity for beneficiaries to contest the decision if they believe the rejection was unjust."

This includes claims-related grievances [Source: LIC India Grievance Redressal _ Official website of Life Insurance Corporation of India_ (1).pdf].\n\n- **Low Cost and Speedy Arbitration**: The Ombudsman provides a mechanism for low-cost and speedy arbitration, which is beneficial for customers seeking a resolution to their claims disputes [Source: 102268- Jeevan Utsav Sales Brochure.pdf; LIC_Bima Shree _Sales Brochure_Eng_06112025.pdf].\n\n- **Procedure Before Approaching Ombudsman**: Before approaching the Insurance Ombudsman, claimants are advised to register their complaint with LIC. If they are not satisfied with the response received, they can then contact the Insurance Ombudsman. Complaints can be registered online or offline [Source: LIC India Grievance Redressal _ Official website of Life Insurance Corporation of India_ (1).pdf].\n\n- **Section 45 of the Insurance Act, 1938**: The Ombudsman also considers the provisions of Section 45 of the Insurance Act, 1938, which states that no policy of life insurance shall be called into question on any ground after three years from the date of the policy [Source: 102268- Jeevan Utsav Sales Brochure.pdf; LIC_Bima Shree _Sales Brochure_Eng_06112025.pdf].\n\nIn summary, the Insurance Ombudsman provides an accessible and efficient means for policyholders to resolve disputes related to claims, ensuring that grievances are addressed fairly and promptly."
