This means that the beneficiaries must provide evidence to counter the claim of fraud [Source: LIC_Jeevan Umang_Sales Brochure_4 inch x 9 inch_Eng (1).pdf].\n\n4. **Policyholder's Defense**:\n   - The insured can defend against the repudiation by proving that any misstatement or suppression of material fact was true to the best of their knowledge and belief, or that there was no deliberate intention to suppress the fact. Additionally, if such misstatements or suppressions were within the knowledge of the insurer, the policy cannot be repudiated on the grounds of fraud [Source: LIC_Jeevan Umang_Sales Brochure_4 inch x 9 inch_Eng (1).pdf].\n\n5. **Time Frame for Contesting**:\n   - A life insurance policy may be called into question at any time within three years from the date of issuance of the policy or the date of commencement of risk [Source: LIC_Jeevan Umang_Sales Brochure_4 inch x 9 inch_Eng (1).pdf].\n\nThese steps ensure that the process is fair and that the beneficiaries have an opportunity to contest the rejection of a claim."
